# MLR_NASSCOM_PROJECT
## Introduction
Let's get familiarised with the some basic terms :-

### Dataset:-
A data set is a collection of data. In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every column of a table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given record of the data set in question.

### Multi linear regression:-
Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that uses just one explanatory variable.

### RMSE:-
The RMSE tells us how well a regression model can predict the value of the response variable in absolute terms while R2 tells us how well a model can predict the value of the response variable in percentage terms.

### Validation Dataset:-
The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters.

### Info of which software I used for this:-
I did this project using Juypter Notebook.(Anaconda Distribution).

### Python Libraries :
The basic python libraries used here are:- 

Pandas : Pandas is a flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.

statsmodels : It is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models.

Scikit-learn : It is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language and features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
